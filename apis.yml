    description: >-
      The Fuel Prices API provides information about the current price of the
      fuel available at the selected station. The data is refreshed every 10
      minutes, but the frequency of change can differ from a few times a day to
      a few times a month depending on the country or the brand of the gas
      station. Using this API makes it possible to make better price-conscious
      decisions while selecting a suitable gas station.

    description: >-
      The Parking Availability API provides information about the current
      availability status of parking sites. The data is refreshed every 10
      minutes and is therefore close to real time. Using this API makes it
      possible to make better off-street parking decisions based on actual
      parking availability (including the number of free spaces).
